                    Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate
                    the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment,
                    the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname
                    "Mad River". On June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon.
