            <h3>Rafting all the way!</h3>
            <p> 
                The purpose of the website is to advertise my rafting company. Excite the user,
                how amazing the experience would be. Essentially convince the user that this location
                and with my boats and possible raft guiders would be the best possible way to go. Entice
                the user that is is very affordable and a new experience that they would find. Make navigating
                and scheduling times on the website would be very important.

            <h3>History Lesson from Wikipedia</h3>
            <p>
                Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the 
                Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river 
                was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname "Mad River". On 
                June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon.
