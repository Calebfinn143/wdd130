            <li>Target Audience</li>
            <p>
                Target audience would be college age students and families. College age students
                would be a great audience, most likely on a mobile device. They would want to know
                how soon in advance they can schedule as they're not likely to plan ahead. Group
                package options for both families as well as college students as they will be glad
                to take any discount for themselves as students or if they come in large groups.
                Available lodging and parking nearby are on some other rafting websites I noticed.
                Also what to expect, as in the difficulty of the rapids. For the avid rapid rafters
                you will want to tell them if these are more calm and family friendly or not for
                the faint of heart.
